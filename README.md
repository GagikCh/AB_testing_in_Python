<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an easily customizable way to evaluate experiments with A/B testing. All is needed just Python with Numpy (and Matplotlib for additional plotting options) and Jupyter Notebook installed on the machine.
<br> Suitable for people who don't want to or cannot afford (or, as in my case, need more flexibility) to buy a third-party software to evaluate your experiments.

Codes can also be used as a part of the process of experiments automation.

This is just an early version. Several things will be added.
